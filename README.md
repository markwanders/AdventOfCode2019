# AdventOfCode2019
My solutions for Advent of Code 2019. Most problems involve using a homemade IntCode computer to execute a series of commands in the form of a list of integers.

* [Day 2](day2/intcode.py) First iteration of the IntCode computer
* [Day 12](day12/moons.py) Simplified N-body problem
* [Day 20](day20/torus.py) Traverse a recursive, torus-shaped maze
* [Day 24](day24/bugs.py) Variation on Conway's Game of life on a recursive, 2D grid
* [Day 25](day25/cryo.py) Use the IntCode computer to play a text adventure game
